# Welcome

We’re excited to announce Rhythm Retreat 2026, the third annual roller skate retreat! Join us from June 12–14, 2026, at the beautiful Statfold Country Park in Tamworth for a weekend that celebrates movement, connection, and community.

Over the past two years, this retreat has grown into something truly special, a space where skaters of all levels come together to connect, learn, and recharge.

## What to expect 

Expect a mix of roller skating sessions, workshops, yoga, meditation, outdoor activities, good food, and evening entertainment, all set in a peaceful, natural setting. Whether you’re a returning retreater or joining us for the first time, you’ll be part of a warm, welcoming community that shares a love for roller skating, movement, and positive vibes.

This three-day skating experience takes place in one of the Midlands’ largest indoor arenas, a one-of-a-kind event in the UK that’s open to skaters of all levels. You can camp on-site under the stars or choose from plenty of great local hotels, all just a short distance from the venue.
